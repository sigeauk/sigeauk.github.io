    </div>

    <p>
        In an era where cyber threats evolve faster than the defenses built to stop them, <span class="highlight">Sigea</span> was founded to provide a more disciplined approach to security monitoring. We believe that detection is not a product you buy, but an engineering discipline you practice.
    </p>

    <h2>Bridging the Intelligence Gap</h2>
    <p>
        Most organizations struggle to translate high-level threat intelligence into effective detection logic. Sigea focuses on <span class="highlight">Threat Informed Detection Engineering</span>—a methodology that ensures every alert in your SOC is rooted in observed adversary behavior.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Open Source?</h2>
    <p>
        Security thrives in the light. By keeping our core frameworks open-source, we ensure that our tools are auditable, community-driven, and accessible to security teams of all sizes. Transparency isn't just a feature; it's a requirement for trust in modern cybersecurity.
    </p>

    <h2>UK-Based Innovation</h2>
    <p>
        Headquartered in the United Kingdom, Sigea is a collective of security researchers and engineers committed to advancing the standard of defensive security globally.
